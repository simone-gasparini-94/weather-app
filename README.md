# Weather App

![Screenshot](./assets/screenshot.png)

## Description

Web app that uses [Virtual Crossing Weather API](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api/) to fetch the weather forecast of a specific location.

The app uses a backend server that hides the API key and acts as reverse proxy.

At the current state, the backend does not modify any data.

## Live Demo

*Note: the backend is hosted on the free version of [Render](https://render.com/), which means that requests can be delayed by 50 seconds or more when inactive.*
