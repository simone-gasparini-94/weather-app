## Description

Web app that uses [Virtual Crossing Weather API](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api/) to get the weather forecast of a specific location.

The app uses a backend server that hides the API key and acts as proxy, forwarding the HTTP request from the frontend to the public API and returning the results.

At the current state, the backend does not modify any data.
